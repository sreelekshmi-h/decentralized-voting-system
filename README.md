--This screenshot shows the front-end buttons created in Remix IDE for interacting with the DecentralizedVoting smart contract. Functions like `addCandidate`, `vote`, `getCandidates`, and `withdrawFees` are accessible through these buttons.


This smart contract implements a decentralized, tamper-proof voting system where:

=>Only the admin (contract creator) can add candidates.

=>Voters can vote once and only for valid candidates.

=>A small fee (0.01 ETH minimum) is required to cast a vote.

=>Votes are counted transparently and securely on-chain.

=>The admin can withdraw all collected ETH from voting fees.
