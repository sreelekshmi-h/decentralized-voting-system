This smart contract implements a decentralized, tamper-proof voting system where:

Only the admin (contract creator) can add candidates.

Voters can vote once and only for valid candidates.

A small fee (0.01 ETH) is required to cast a vote.

Votes are counted transparently and securely on-chain.

The admin can withdraw all collected ETH from voting fees.
